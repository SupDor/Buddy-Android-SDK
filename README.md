# Buddy Android SDK

These release notes are for the Buddy Platform Android SDK.

Please refer to [buddyplatform.com/docs](https://buddyplatform.com/docs) for more details on the Android SDK.

## Introduction

We realized most app developers end up writing the same code over and over again: user management, photo management, geolocation, checkins, metadata, and other basic features. Buddy enables developers to build cloud-connected apps without having to write, test, manage or scale server-side code and infrastructure.

Buddy's easy-to-use, scenario-focused APIs let you spend more time building your app and less time worrying about backend infrastructure.

The Android SDK handles the following functionality:

* Building and formatting requests
* Managing authentication
* Parsing responses
* Loading and saving credentials

## Getting Started

To get started with the Buddy Platform SDK, please reference the _Getting Started_ series of documents at [buddyplatform.com/docs](https://buddyplatform.com/docs). You will need an App ID and Key before you can use the SDK. The _Getting Started_ documents will walk you through obtaining everything you need and show you where to find the SDK for your platform.

Application IDs and Keys are obtained at the Buddy Developer Dashboard at [buddyplatform.com](https://buddyplatform.com/login).

Full documentation for Buddy's services are available at [buddyplatform.com/docs](https://buddyplatform.com/docs).

## Installing the SDK

### Install from Maven/Gradle

**Note:** The following instructions were written for Google's [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html)

In your build.gradle file under 'src', add a line for the Buddy Android SDK dependency

    dependencies {
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile 'com.buddy:androidsdk:+'
    }

Go to File > Project Structure and select the Project tab. Change the `Default Library Repository` from `jcenter()` to `mavenCentral`.

This will install the latest release of the Buddy Android SDK.
**Note:** If you wish to limit yourself to a narrower set of releases, you can do so like this (e.g. the latest release in the 3.0.0 series):

    compile 'com.buddy:androidsdk:3.0.0+'

At this point you will be able to import from com.buddy.sdk to access the Buddy Classes
(e.g. import com.buddy.sdk.BuddyClient)

### Install Locally

#### Prerequisites

To build the SDK you need to:

1.  Install the [Android SDK Tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
2.  Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to the Android SDK install directory
3.  Open the Android SDK Manager and make sure you have installed Android SDK Build-tools 19.1 and Android 2.3.3 (API 10)
4.  Windows only - Install the [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html#javasejdk), and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the JDK install directory

#### Build and Install

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine
2.  From the root of this repository, run `./gradlew build` (Mac/Linux) or `gradlew.bat build` (Windows) to build the SDK
3.  Look in the **library/build/libs** folder to find the JARs.
4.  Copy the JAR files and paste them into your app/libs folder


**Note:** You will have to add the following dependencies to the `dependencies { ... }` block of your application's build.gradle file:

    // Sample dependencies block
    dependencies {
        compile 'com.loopj.android:android-async-http:1.4.5'
        compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.2.+'
        compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
        compile files('libs/buddy-sdk-0.2.0.jar')
    }

You are now able to use the Buddy Android SDK in your application.

## Using the Android SDK

Visit the [Buddy Dashboard](https://buddyplatform.com) to obtain your application ID and key.

### Initialize The SDK

    import com.buddy.sdk;
    // ...
    // Create the SDK client
    Buddy.init(myContext, "appId", "appKey");
    
If you need to have multiple clients, for example if you need to talk to multiple users from your app, you can capture the result from `Buddy.init` and call through those clients:

    BuddyClientOptions opt1 = new BuddyClientOptions();
    opt1.instanceName = "client1";
    
    BuddyClient client1 = Buddy.init(app1, key1, opt1);
    
    BuddyClientOptions opt2 = new BuddyClientOptions();
    opt1.instanceName = "client2";
    
    BuddyClient client2 = Buddy.init(app1, key1, opt2);
    
    client1.loginUser("user1", "pw1", null);
    client2.loginUser("user2", "pw2", null);
    
The `Buddy` static class is has the same signature as the `BuddyClient` class, and is shorthand for calling the most recently created client via a `Buddy.init()` call.

### User Flow

There are helper functions for creating, logging in, and logging out users:

#### Create User

    Buddy.createUser("someUser", "somePassword", null, null, null, null, null, null, new BuddyCallback<User>(User.class) {
      @Override
      public void completed(BuddyResult<User> result) {
        if (result.getIsSuccess()) {
          Log.w(APP_LOG, "User created: " + result.getResult().userName);
        }
      }
    });

#### User Login

    Buddy.loginUser("someUser", "somePassword", new BuddyCallback<User>(User.class) {...});

#### User Logout
    
    // Logout is simple!
    Buddy.logoutUser();
  
### REST Interface
    
Each SDK provides general wrappers that make REST calls to Buddy. For all the calls you can either create a wrapper java class such as those found in `com.buddy.sdk.models`, or you can simply pass a type of `JsonObject` to return a standard Gson JsonObject.

#### POST

In this example we'll create a checkin. Take a look at the [create checkin REST documentation](https://buddyplatform.com/docs/Checkins#CreateCheckin) then:

    // Create a checkin
    Location location = new Location("");
    location.setLatitude(47.61d);
    location.setLongitude(-122.33d);
    Map<String,Object> parameters = new HashMap<String,Object>();
    parameters.put("comment", "My first checkin");
    parameters.put("description", "This is where I was doing that thing.");
    parameters.put("location", String.format("%f,%f", location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude()));
    Buddy.<JsonObject>post("/checkins", parameters, new BuddyCallback<JsonObject>(JsonObject.class) {
        @Override
        public void completed(BuddyResult<JsonObject> result) {
            if (result.getIsSuccess()) {
                JsonObject obj = result.getResult();
                // get the ID of the created checkin.
                String id = obj.get("id").getAsString();
            }
        }
    });

#### GET

We now can call GET to [search for the checkin](https://buddyplatform.com/docs/Checkins#SearchCheckins) we just created!

    // Search for the checkin we created in the previous example
    Map<String, Object> parameters = new HashMap<String, Object>();
    parameters.put("locationRange", "47.61, -122.33, 1500");
    Buddy.<JsonObject>get("/checkins", parameters, new BuddyCallback<JsonObject>(JsonObject.class) {
        @Override
        public void completed(BuddyResult<JsonObject> result) {
            if (result.getIsSuccess()) {
                JsonObject obj = result.getResult();
                // Get the pageResults response as a JsonArray
                JsonArray _res = obj.get("pageResults").getAsJsonArray();
                Log.w(APP_LOG, _res.toString());
            }
        }
    });

#### PUT/PATCH/DELETE

Each remaining REST verb is available through the Buddy SDK using the same pattern as the POST and GET examples.

### Working With Files

Buddy offers support for binary files. The Android SDK works with files through our REST interface similarly to other API calls.

**Note:** Responses for files deviate from the standard Buddy response templates. See the [Buddy Platform documentation](https://buddyplatform.com/docs) for more information.

#### Upload A File

Here we demonstrate uploading a picture. For all binary files (e.g. blobs and videos), the pattern is the same, but with a different path and different parameters. For full documentation see our [Media and Files](https://buddyplatform.com/docs/Media%20and%20Files) documentation page.

    BuddyFile buddyFile = new BuddyFile(new File(...), "image/jpg");
    Map<String,Object> parameters = new HashMap<String,Object>();
    parameters.put("caption", "From Android");
    parameters.put("data", buddyFile);
    Buddy.<Picture>post("/pictures", parameters, new BuddyCallback<Picture>(Picture.class){
        @Override
        public void completed(BuddyResult<Picture> result) {
            if (result.getIsSuccess()) {
                Log.w(APP_LOG, "It worked!");
            }
        }
    });

#### Download A File

To download a file send a GET request with BPFile as the operation type. This sample downloads the picture we uploaded in the "Upload File" example:

    Buddy.get(String.format("/pictures/%s/file", fileId), null, new BuddyCallback<BuddyFile>(BuddyFile.class) {
        @Override
        public void completed(BuddyResult<BuddyFile> file) {
            // Do something with your picture!
            Log.w(APP_LOG, file.getResult().getContentType());
        }
    });

**Note:** Responses for files deviate from the standard Buddy response templates. See the [Buddy Platform documentation](https://buddyplatform.com/docs) for more information.
